## üé® Logo Design

The logo represents:
- **Lightning bolt**: Energy and power monitoring
- **Circuit elements**: CPU/hardware monitoring (RAPL interface)
- **Python-inspired curves**: The Python programming language
- **Green colors**: Sustainable/green computing focus
- **Tech aesthetics**: Modern software development

The logo uses energy-themed colors (gold/orange lightning) combined with Python blue and green computing themes to represent the project's focus on energy-efficient software development.
